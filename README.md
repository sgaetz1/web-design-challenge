# web-design-challenge

This is a git repository for my html/css homework.
Url for the site is https://sgaetz1.github.io/web-design-challenge/.
The Resources folder contains cities.csv and an assets_images folder which includes the scatterplots used on the web site.
The html folder contains all the html for all the required pages of the assignment, except for index.html which is the main page.
Csv_to_html.ipynb contains the jupyter notebook that I used to write the python code to convert the csv file to an html table. The html code to build the table is 
found in html_table. Sam Ziegler was a huge help in helping me troubleshoot this part of the project, thank you Sam!
Style.css contains all the css code to style the wed site and is used by all of the html files. I would also like to acknowledge getbootstrap.com for being a source I used
to get my navigation bar functioning properly.
